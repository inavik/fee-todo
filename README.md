### TODO List Application
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This front end application was created using JavaScript functionality. The user
is able to create a new list item and delete existing list items. When the user
hovers over the list item, an "X" appears and clicking on that "X" deletes the
item. Clicking on the circle to the left of the item toggles whether it is
complete or not. There is always an incomplete item count displayed in the bottom
left corner for the user to see. Lastly, the user is able to click on "Clear completed",
which removes any todo item that is marked complete.
