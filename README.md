# TODO List Application

This front end application was created using JavaScript functionality. A user
is able to create a new task, delete existing tasks, and strike through completed tasks.
When a task is hovered, an "X" appears on the right, which allows the user to delete the task. Likewise, clicking on the circle to the left of the task shows the task as completed.
As new tasks are added, completed, and deleted, the counter displayed in the bottom left corner is updated to show number of tasks left.
